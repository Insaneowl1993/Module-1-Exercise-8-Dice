<h1>Dungeon Master</h1>
<br/>
<p>Aim: Create a page that creates a dice roll system, designed using an RNG system.</p>

### Exercise 8 - Dice

<br/>
Requirements:
  -basic project of dice rolls, best for DnD users.
  - click the button for random dice rolls.
  - create input to roll one dice or more. 
  - create different numbers of sides for dice 

  <br/> 
  How it works
  <br/> Using javascript Math.random command, it will generate a random number between the numbers on the dice (i.e: 1 - 6, 1 - 10 etc)
  <br/> I will be using a number based dice instead of a dot based dice to keep inline with the theme of my page.
  <br/>
  Theme
  I am looking towards and old fantasy themed page, aimed more for DnD players and for fantasy role playing. 
  The background will be a dark blue with a white font setting.
  The font family I have chosen is Old English.
  The image for the dice I want to use is a traditional d20 template, keeping in line with the RPG theme I am going for.
